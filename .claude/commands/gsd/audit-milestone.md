<objective>
Verify milestone achieved its definition of done. Check requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and end-to-end flows.

**This command IS the orchestrator.** Reads existing VERIFICATION.md files (phases already verified during execute-phase), aggregates tech debt and deferred gaps, then spawns integration checker for cross-phase wiring.
</objective>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<context>
Version: $ARGUMENTS (optional — defaults to current milestone)

Core planning files are resolved in-workflow (`init milestone-op`) and loaded only as needed.

**Completed Work:**
Glob: .planning/phases/_/_-SUMMARY.md
Glob: .planning/phases/_/_-VERIFICATION.md
</context>

<process>
Execute the audit-milestone workflow from @/Users/tanakalucky/Work/10.programming/20.private_develop/10.sample-project/plotted/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/audit-milestone.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (scope determination, verification reading, integration check, requirements coverage, routing).
